    "    * Datasets: `california`, `gbsg2`, `lymph`, and `recur`.\n",
    "2. Run the notebook `training/train_lifelines_models.ipynb` to train the classical survival models via the [`lifelines` library](https://lifelines.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n",
    "3. Run the notebook `training/train_nets.ipynb` to train the network-based survival models.\n",
    "    * Note that it is possible to run multiple instances of this notebook. This allows the parallelization of the training processes.\n",
    "4. Run the notebook `plotting/plot.ipynb` to evaluate the models and produce tables and plots-\n",
    "    * One has to set the parameter `dataset_name` to the name of the dataset for which one wants to evaluate the models."
